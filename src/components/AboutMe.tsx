        <p className='mt-3 text-base text-zinc-900'>
            I’m a self-taught front-end developer with a non-tech background and a deep passion for building interactive web experiences. My journey began with curiosity and a drive to understand how websites work, which led me to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own. <br /> <br />
            I specialize in React and modern tools like Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. What I love most is turning ideas into clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. <br /><br />
            My mission is to grow into a world-class frontend engineer, contribute to impactful projects, and one day mentor others who are just starting their journey — just like I did.
